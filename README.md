# Kanban Board
Kanban is a popular project management methodology that helps visualize work, maximize efficiency, and continuously improve processes. Using Kanban boards, teams can track tasks across different stages, such as To Do, In Progress, Done, and more. Each task is represented as a card that moves from one stage to another, providing a clear and immediate overview of the work status.

### Advantages of Using Kanban:

- Visual Workflow: Allows teams to see all tasks and their current status at a glance.
- Increased Efficiency: Enables better task prioritization and workload management, minimizing idle time.
- Flexibility: Adapts easily to changes, accommodating new tasks or adjustments to ongoing ones.
- Continuous Improvement: Promotes reflection on progress and process adjustments for better productivity.
- Collaboration: Supports teamwork by making task ownership and status clear to everyone involved.

### Features of Our Kanban Board App
